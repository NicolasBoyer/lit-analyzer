## Disclaimer

wapitis-analyzer is a fork of [lit-analyzer](https://github.com/runem/lit-analyzer). It was created to work with [wapitis](https://nicolasboyer.github.io/wapitis).

The only modification is adding [https://github.com/NicolasBoyer/web-component-analyzer](https://github.com/NicolasBoyer/web-component-analyzer) which is a fork of [https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer](https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer) to add wapitis specific configuration.

Prefer lit-analyzer to work with any other configuration than wapitis.
